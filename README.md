# Welcome to BeerJSON 2.0-draft working group repository

This is a repository for development of BeerJSON interchange format
specification. It is based on yet unfinished
[BeerXML 2 standard (PDF)](http://users.speakeasy.net/%7Eantonw/beer_xml/BeerXML_v2_01.pdf).

## Documentation
Current documentation is published at https://beerjson.github.io/beerjson/

## Structure of the repository

* Current development is done in the Master branch.
* Each published version has its own branch or tag
* Changes are proposed by creating a
  [pull request](https://github.com/beerjson/beerjson/pulls) that should be
  reviewed by members of working group.
* Issues, questions and suggestions should be posted to
  [Issues](https://github.com/beerjson/beerjson/issues)

## CI and tests

For safe manipulations with json schemas, we have set of tests in the tests
folder. We check that json is valid for serializations and json is valid
according to the beerjson schema. To run tests do following steps after repo
fork or clone

```bash
yarn
yarn test
```

or

```bash
npm i
npm test
```

## Version

This is BeerJSON 2.0-draft (currently in progress)

## State

This spec is unfinished yet, JSON schema is being converted from BeerXML 2.0 XSD
files.

  Note that one of the benefits of using json schemas is a possibility to use
  tests and CI. Please ensure that tests are green before submitting a pull
  request. And all new entities in the json schema are covered.
